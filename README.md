# numworks-python-graphic
The purpose of this repository is to create a set of python files to make graphical interfaces on the NumWorks calculator.

To test the different scripts, it's a bit tricky because you have to import these scripts on the calculator from the NumWorks Workshop (https://workshop.numworks.com/).

This project has currently 4 python scripts:
 -gbutton.py
 -ginput.py
 -glayout.py
 -gwidget.py
File names are written in lower case because Epsilon does not support upper case in python script names.
