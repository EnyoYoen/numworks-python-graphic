# numworks-python-graphic
The purpose of this repository is to create a set of python files to make graphical interfaces on the NumWorks calculator.    

To test the different scripts, it's a bit tricky because you have to import these scripts on the calculator from the NumWorks Workshop (https://workshop.numworks.com/).

This project has currently 4 different python scripts with a dev version for each one (same name but with a 'd' after the file name):  
 -gbutton.py  
 -ginput.py  
 -glayout.py  
 -gwidget.py  
File names are written in lower case because Epsilon does not support upper case in python script names.
